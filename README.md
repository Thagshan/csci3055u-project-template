## About the Language

> _Scala is a general-purpose programming language, created by Martin Odersky, to provide support for functional programming and a strong static type system. The language is promoted by Lightbend, forerly known as Typesafe, which promotes an open source platform for building reactive applications for the JVM, and they are also one of the main contributors of Reactive Streams. The language itself was designed to be concise, and many of Scala's design decisions were aimed to address criticisms of Java. Although Scala has been around for many years and is used for backend code for large corporations, like Twitter, There are lots of people that have not heard about Scala. There are many reasons to learn Scala. The language is very important, very effecient, fast, and is most relevent in big data._ 

>_The nomenclature for Scala comes for the word scaleable, and inturn, Scala is meant to represent a scaleable language. While there are other languages that are scalable, like Java or Python, there is a limit to their scalability. Scala, on the other hand, was built to be scalable, and therefore can be used for scripting, writing basic applications and writing large enterprise applications. This is without a doubt, one of the its most important features. For Computer Science students pursuing careers in Big Data, in order to work with the big data frameworks Hadoop and Spark, they must also know how to program in Scala, sine Spark only uses Scala, and Hadoop uses both Java and Scala._

> _Scala was also created by modifying Java.Since the design decisions around the language were centered around addressing critisisms of Java, there is also no boilerplate code for Scala. This means that only code relevent to the its function needs to be implemented. Like Java, Scala also supports concurrency  which is important because we live in an age of octa-cores. This means that we need to design code that is effecient using all 8 cores of a system. Scala is also a functional programming language, and is is faster than java, python, node.js, and adobe. Comparatively, you can program the same software in Scala as you can in Java, using fewer lines.  A program that needs approximately 20 lines of code in Java only needs around 5-6 lines in Scala to do the exact same thing._

>_Finally, another advantage of Scala is that it works together with Java. Both Java and Scala use JVM. This means a Java project supports Scala, and Scala projects support Java. You get the benefits of both languages in one program. For any programmer familiar with Java, it wont take long to master Scala and take advantage of both languages in one program._

object HelloWorld {
    def main(args: Array[String]) {
      println("Hello, world!")
    }
  }
```
